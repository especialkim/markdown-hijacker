Okay, I can help you with that. I will propose the commands to commit your changes and then push them to the remote repository.

First, I will commit the changes with a message indicating that the PR review feedback has been applied.


---

```bash
cd /Users/yongminkim/Workspace/Obsidian/Yongmini/.obsidian/plugins/markdown-hijacker && git commit -am "Refactor: Apply PR review feedback"
```

```
yongminkim@Yongminui-Mac-Studio markdown-hijacker % cd /Users/yongminkim/Workspace/Obsidian/Yongmini/.obsidi
an/plugins/markdown-hijacker && git commit -am "Refactor: Apply PR review feedback"                     cd /
Users/yongminkim/Workspace/Obsidian/Yongmini/.obsidian/plugins/markdown-hijacker && git commit -am "Refactor
